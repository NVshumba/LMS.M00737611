## Project discription & key features
Using Sublime text I have created a simple library management system for staff members to use in their day to day task as a librarian. The system holds a list of all books within the system and has other helpful features like add books,issue books to members , add new staff members, delete books and calculate a Â£1 fine for everyday a book is overdue.
